- There are two bugs in the GSI script
 (1) Ensemble mean calculation for firstguess is failing, so the EnKF actually
     just using member001 data the ensemble mean
     "Fixing" this results in the model randomly blowing up
  (2) For satellite data cycling, there is an == where there should be a !=

- EnKF experiments cannot be done with 'wrfinput' for DA, because enkf executable
  modifies the NSTART_HOUR parameter, which doesn't exist in wrfinput files

- Diapost needs variables that are not in the auxhist files. So for the ensemble mean, for
  the analysis time, I'm using the restart/wrfinput file. I don't know if this can negatively
  impact the integrity of the system.
  Search for "jza20140122" in the gsi script.

1.1.4
  - Added GFDL tracker script 
  - Separated UPP and Diapost scripts from the cummulative "post_fcst" script, since their requirements are
    different and we may need to start using MPI for UPP.
  - Added code to workflow_generator to allow separate queue for different processes. By default, Diapost
    will now use bigmem, since it is needed for the 3km runs
  - Some bugfixes for hourly cycling
  - Added code in config files to automatically detect if we're running on Theia and set variables and
    modules accordingly.
  - Added STRICT_MODE functionality
  - Added daffy_common script that runs at the beginning of all job scripts
  - Added 3km configuration to contrib after testing 3km cold start, gsi, and HWRF experiments on Theia
1.1.3
  - Separated the code that processes the observation config files into its own library, so that we can put the
    observation files' timestamp in to the local database (config.xml). This also allows us to finally 
    have the SPORADIC_DATASETS in gsi.cfg.sh funtional.
  - Added ability to Generate UPP output at less than hourly granularity. This means I also had to change
     the convention of the output file.
1.1.2
  - Added script to automatically archive to MSS when experiment completes and also remove a lot of the data
     -> This is all configurable in archive.cfg.sh
  - Changed "conventional" to "control_v1"
  - Made TCVitals assimilation an entry in the gsi_ob_mappings rather than having separate settings for it
    in the GSI and experiment config files
  - Added "postproc_experiment" task, which performs experiment-wide postprocessing (e.g. experimental averages
    for domain stats and TC vitals). This makes things a little cleaner and ensures that the experimental averages
    account for all forecasts, as opposed to before where it was possible that the averages would be missing
    data from cycles that failed and finished later.
  - Changed task name of "postproc_fcst" to "post_fcst". This makes it possible to see what cycle the postproc
    jobs corespond to when using qstat
  - Added EnKF configuration parameters to enkf.cfg.sh, so the template does not need to be modified.
  - Global database merging is functional, although we will probably add additional elements in the future
  - Made changes to reflect new directory structure (i.e. lfs2->lfs3 migration
  - Added logic to check when experiment completes.

1.1.1
  - This is an intermediate update with some bug fixes as well as added functionality, including
    - changes to enable HWRF 2014 
    - Generation of (partial) experiment.xml file containing key data about the experiment. In the
      future, these will be merged with a global XML database of experiment runs
    - Changes for comGSI 3.3
    - Made it easier to migrate to different computers with different directory structures
      by adding new config variables.
    - Changed WPS script and config to use pattern instead of prefix and suffix
    - Added scripts for running UPP on the ensemble forecast prior and posteriors
    - EnKF now works with wrfinput (NOTE: this required changes to the EnKF code)
    - Fixed some issues that propped up with workflow generation
    - Related to the above, we now create a separate analysis file after GSI/EnKF in order to 
      ensure idempotence of HWRF script
    - Added 'MODEL_CONFIG_ID' parameter to configuration. This will be used to simplify
      using different versions of HWRF and associated tools. It will affect where DAFFY will 
      look for executables and static, previously generated data, related to HWRF.
    - Made global logging more elegant and useful
    - Added scripts to run UPP on the ensemble prior/posterior
    - Added functionality for running a series of cold start experiments

1.1.0.9
  - buggy release with the new XML database scheme:
    - Generation of (partial) experiment.xml file containing key data about the experiment. In the
      future, these will be merged with a global XML database of experiment runs
    - Changes for comGSI 3.3

1.1.0.1
  - This is an intermediate update with some bug fixes as well as added functionality, including
    - changes to enable HWRF 2014 to be used with GSI experiments (does NOT work with EnKF yet)
    - Made it easier to migrate to different systems with different directory structures
      by adding new config variables.
    - Changed WPS script and config to use pattern instead of prefix and suffix

1.1.0
  - Added execution of domain average code for AOML OSSE
  - Added EnKF functionality
  - Changed postprocessing paradigm - to use scripts in $SCRIPTS/post
  - Changed GSI-experiment related portions of code to fit new paradigm
  - Added functionality to ignore SIGINT while Rocoto is being invoked to 
    reduce the possibilty of the state file being corrupted

1.0.3.2
 - Modified to use external version of Diapost. Currently, this is the HEDAS/Sim version
 -> walltime of postproc was increased accordingly, since this one takes about 3.5 minutes
   per domain Jet
 - Fixed tile_vs_coldstart
 - Added @y parameter to the code that translates GSI configuration specifiers (i.e. cfg files in conf/gsi_obs_mappings)
   to support file names that use 2-digit year

1.0.3.1
 - Added TCVitals assimilation ability
 - Added average error plot generation

1.0.3
 - Fixed bug in gsi job script that was preventing diag_conv_* files from being generated
 - Implemented --reuse option
   -> Reads from standard or compressed files
 - removes the met_nmm files from WPS directories (optionally, in real.sh) and removes FILE* files (in wps.sh)
 - Made the generation of standard plots optional in postproc config
 - Removed "_sourceit" workaround since there's nothing ZSH-specific now in the config files
 - Moved non-entrypoint python scripts to lib/
 - Added "-d" and "-v" options to rungsi
 - Started logging info to $DAFFY_LOG
 - Added satellite input/angle data cycling to GSI script

1.0.2
 - Simplified the GSI script (i.e. new paradigm for specifying obs to use)
 - Fixed some postprocessing issues
 - Added generation of standard plots to the postprocessing script (for cycling)

1.0.1 
 - Added --warm-init option that starts from an existing output directory (not GFS)
 - Paradigm shift :
  - The workflow definition file is only generated when the --cold-init
    or --warm-init option is passed in.
 - Made some fixes to the postprocessing scripts (including name change : postproc.zsh -> postproc_cycle.zsh )
